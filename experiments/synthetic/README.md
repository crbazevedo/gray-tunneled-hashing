# Synthetic Experiments

This directory contains configurations, notebooks, and results for synthetic experiments with Gray-Tunneled Hashing.

Synthetic experiments are used to:
- Validate the algorithm on controlled data
- Test theoretical properties
- Benchmark performance on different data distributions
- Compare against baseline hashing methods

## Experiment Types

- **Distance Preservation**: Tests how well the algorithm preserves pairwise distances
- **Scalability**: Tests performance with varying dataset sizes and dimensions
- **Code Length Analysis**: Tests the effect of different binary code lengths
