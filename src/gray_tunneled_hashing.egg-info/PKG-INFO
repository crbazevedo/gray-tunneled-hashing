# Gray-Tunneled Hashing

This repository hosts all source code, scripts, applications, and experiments for prototyping and validating a theoretical result about Gray-Tunneled Hashing, and implementing a Gray-Tunneled Hashing algorithm that can be plugged into any binary vector DB / ANN index (Hamming distance).

## What is Gray-Tunneled Hashing?

Gray-Tunneled Hashing is a novel hashing approach designed for binary vector databases and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search using Hamming distance. The algorithm aims to preserve distance relationships in the original embedding space while mapping to binary codes, enabling efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.

## Project Structure

- `src/gray_tunneled_hashing/` - Main Python package with algorithms, data generators, and evaluation metrics
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts for running experiments
- `apps/` - Demo applications and CLI tools
- `experiments/` - Experiment configurations, notebooks, and results
- `project_management/` - Project planning, backlog, and documentation

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10

## Quickstart

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crbazevedo/gray-tunneled-hashing.git
   cd gray-tunneled-hashing
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Running Tests

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

For quiet output:
```bash
pytest -q
```

### Running the First Synthetic Experiment

Run the synthetic experiment script:
```bash
python scripts/run_synthetic_experiment.py
```

This will generate synthetic embeddings, run the hashing algorithm, and print summary metrics.

### Running the Demo CLI

Run the demo CLI application:
```bash
python apps/demo_cli.py
```

Or with custom parameters:
```bash
python apps/demo_cli.py --n-points 100 --dim 64
```
