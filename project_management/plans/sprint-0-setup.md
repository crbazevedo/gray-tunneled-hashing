# Sprint 0: Setup Sprint

## Goals

Sprint 0 aims to establish a solid structural foundation for the Gray-Tunneled Hashing project, making it ready for real experiments and algorithm development.

## Tasks

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Set up Python project with `src/` layout
   - Create package skeleton with algorithms, data, and evaluation modules
   - Establish tests, scripts, apps, and experiments directories

2. **Python Project Configuration**
   - Create `pyproject.toml` with dependencies and build system
   - Configure linting and formatting tools (ruff, black)

3. **Core Package Implementation**
   - Implement `GrayTunneledHasher` class stub with clear API
   - Create synthetic data generators
   - Create evaluation metrics placeholders

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up pytest
   - Create at least one passing test for basic functionality

5. **Scripts and Applications**
   - Create synthetic experiment script
   - Create demo CLI application

6. **Documentation**
   - Update root README with quickstart guide
   - Create project management documentation
   - Document contribution guidelines

## Definition of Done

- All directory structure exists
- `pytest` passes with no failures
- `scripts/run_synthetic_experiment.py` runs successfully
- `apps/demo_cli.py` runs with default arguments
- Root `README.md` explains installation, testing, and running experiments

## Timeline

Sprint 0 is a one-time setup sprint to establish project foundations.
